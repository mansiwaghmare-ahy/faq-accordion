            <p class="answer">Frontend Mentor is an online platform that provides real-world coding challenges for web
                developers. It helps users improve their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building projects from
                design mockups. Developers can also receive feedback and compare solutions with others in the community.

            <p class="answer">Yes, Frontend Mentor gives you many challenges for free, but some projects and features
                are behind a paid Pro subscription. The majority of their coding challenges are available without
                paying, and you can practice and build projects with those free ones. Premium challenges and certain
                extras (like advanced design files) require a Pro membership.

            <p class="answer">Yes, you can use Frontend Mentor projects in your portfolio. In fact, that's one of the
                main purposes of the platform to let developers showcase real-world projects they've built from the
                designs.

                or their official Discord where members share advice and tips, submit your solution for feedback to
                receive suggestions.
